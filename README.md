# Sysadmin Challenges

This repo contains all of the Training Challenges we use at CS++ to train our sysadmins.

This means that no matter the year or course, all sysadmins have common experiences and a shared understanding of the technologies we use at CS++.

## Structure
Each challenge is in its own folder, with a `README.md` file that contains the instructions for the challenge.
These challenges may contain other useful files.

## Completing a Challenge
Most challenges involve cloning a VM made for the challenge.
If not, the relevant instructions will be in the `README.md` file for the challenge.
You should create a write-up while completing the challenge, which should be submitted once completed.
The instructions are deliberately vague, to promote research and problem-solving skills.
If you get stuck, you can always ask for help!
